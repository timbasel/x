# X

An Xperimental programming language that aims to bridge the gap between compiled and interpreted languages.

The goal of X is to create a language that is faster than Python, as readable as Go and as maintainable as Rust.

## Syntax

```rust
fn main() {
  a := 42

  if a > 9000 {
    print("It's over 9000.") // print a string
  } else {
    print("It's only {a}.") // print a variable using string interpolation
  }
}
```
